## `hyde_cpp`

### **Deprecated**

**Hybridization detection using phylogenetic invariants.**

This is a legacy C++ version of the program HyDe. Users are encouraged
to use the more up-to-date Python package (>= v0.4.0): [HyDe](https://github.com/pblischak/HyDe).
We don't plan to update this package, but are keeping it here for users who may have
started using it.

`hyde_cpp` requires a C++11 compliant compiler.

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/pblischak/hyde_cpp.git
cd hyde_cpp

# Compile and install
make && sudo make install

# To see run options type
hyde_cpp -h
```
